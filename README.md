# Helpdesk Backend

This project is the backend engine of an AI-enabled Helpdesk system designed to automate and streamline customer support workflows. It handles ticket creation, categorization, status tracking, and intelligent responses, reducing manual effort and improving response time in support operations.

The system is built to reflect how real enterprise support platforms work, where multiple users raise issues, tickets move through different states, and AI assists both users and support teams.

## 🚀 What This Backend Does
- Accepts and processes support tickets from users
- Maintains ticket lifecycle (open, in-progress, resolved)
- Stores and retrieves ticket data reliably
- Integrates AI to generate contextual responses and assistance
- Exposes structured APIs for frontend consumption
- Logs system activity for monitoring and debugging
